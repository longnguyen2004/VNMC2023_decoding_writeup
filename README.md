# VNMC2023 Decoding Writeup

This is my writeups of all the cipher puzzles in VNMC2023: Oblitus Requiem, where I'll tell the story of my journey during each puzzle, including all the hurdles along the way.

Massive thanks to RyuKot/Yunema ([osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24730995)) for accompanying me along the way, and the VNMC2023 staff for coming up with these super fun puzzles ðŸ˜„

Here are the puzzles, in chronological order
